    In an AWS Multi-AZ, multi-region database, the time it takes to recover from an outage 
    and the amount of data you might lose depend on whether the issue is in a single 
    Availability Zone (AZ) or an entire region. For a single AZ outage, the system can usually 
    recover in less than 1 minute without losing any data, as it automatically switches to a backup instance. 
    However, if thereâ€™s a single region outage, recovery might take from minutes to hours 
    and could involve some manual steps, while you might lose a little data, typically within a few seconds 
    to minutes, due to the way data is replicated across regions.

    Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage - Less than 1 minute
    Minimum RTO for a single region outage - Minutes to hours
    Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage - Zero (no data loss)
    Minimum RPO for a single region outage - Seconds to minutes (potential minimal data loss)
